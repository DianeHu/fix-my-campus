# Cindy Pan feedback

* The showing:category isn't very obvious, I didn't see it
until you pointed it out.

* Actual tags should be clickable, I want to click on them to filter
for tags.

* I didn't notice you could comment at all, there should be a "comment" button by
the follow button.

* I didn't know I had to enter to edit things after I clicked the edit button.

* I didn't really know what following a post meant until you explained it.

* I want a back to top button, I don't like having to scroll all the way back up.

* Not being able to login from the home page is not very user friendly.

* I want a way to recover messages I deleted in my inbox.
