I enjoyed my experience on your Fix My Campus website, and I think it has the potential to be useful here at Duke. The account authentication was a good idea to ensure that Duke students are the ones posting on the website. I also like that users can easily like and comment on posts. One typo was found on the contacts page, which had a misspelling of the Rubenstein Rare Books and Manuscripts Library. It could also be cool if users had the ability to make a profile on the site to include information about their year, major, residence hall, contact info, etc.
