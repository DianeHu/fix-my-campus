Hi Diane,

I quickly checked out your FMC website. here are my thoughts, in brief:

Pros:

* Has all of / more functionality than the FMC facebook page
* Core functions are easily accessible once logged in
* UI is laid out clearly, easy to navigate to the desired pages
* Filter functions seem useful

Cons:

* Clicking on certain UI elements is buggy
* Login isn't accessible
* Authenticate account doesn't appear trustworthy: doesn't use Shibboleth UI
